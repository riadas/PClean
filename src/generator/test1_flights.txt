Based on the dataset excerpt, I'll create a "table.json" file with the specified schema information. The data appears to be about flight schedules with departure and arrival times.

{
  "db_id": "flight_schedules",
  "table_names": ["flights"],
  "column_names": [
    [0, "tuple_id"],
    [0, "src"],
    [0, "flight"],
    [0, "sched_dep_time"],
    [0, "act_dep_time"],
    [0, "sched_arr_time"],
    [0, "act_arr_time"]
  ],
  "column_types": [
    "number",
    "text",
    "text",
    "time",
    "time",
    "time",
    "time"
  ],
  "foreign_keys": [],
  "primary_keys": [0]
}

This schema represents:
- A single table named "flights"
- 7 columns with their respective data types
- tuple_id as the primary key
- No foreign keys since this is a single table
- Appropriate data types for each column (number for IDs, text for source and flight numbers, time for all time-related fields)
