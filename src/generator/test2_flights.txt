Based on the error description provided, this appears to be a case of value swaps, where arrival and departure times might be inconsistent across different sources for the same flight. Here's the appropriate error JSON:

{
  "swaps": [
    ["sched_dep_time", ["flight"], "src"],
    ["act_dep_time", ["flight"], "src"],
    ["sched_arr_time", ["flight"], "src"],
    ["act_arr_time", ["flight"], "src"]
  ]
}

This JSON indicates that:
- For each time-related column (scheduled/actual departure/arrival times), there might be inconsistencies
- These inconsistencies occur for the same flight number (identified by the "flight" column)
- The inconsistencies arise when the same flight is reported by different sources (the "src" column)
- The other error types (typos and unit_errors) are omitted as they weren't mentioned in the error description
