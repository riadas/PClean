Based on the dataset excerpt, I'll create a JSON schema that matches the specified format. Here's the "table.json" content:

{
    "db_id": "rental_data",
    "table_names": ["rental_listings"],
    "column_names": [
        [0, "id"],
        [0, "room_type"],
        [0, "monthly_rent"],
        [0, "county"],
        [0, "state"]
    ],
    "column_types": [
        "integer",
        "text",
        "decimal",
        "text",
        "text"
    ],
    "foreign_keys": [],
    "primary_keys": [0]
}

This schema represents:
- A single table named "rental_listings"
- 5 columns: id (Column1), room_type, monthly_rent, county, and state
- Appropriate data types for each column
- The id column (index 0) as the primary key
- No foreign keys since this is a single table with no relationships

The schema captures all the essential information from the dataset while following the specified format. The column types are assigned based on the data content shown in the excerpt.
