Based on the dataset excerpt, I'll create a "table.json" file with the specified schema. The data appears to be from a single table about rental properties, so I'll structure it accordingly:

{
    "db_id": "rental_properties",
    "table_names": ["rentals"],
    "column_names": [
        [0, "Column1"],
        [0, "Room Type"],
        [0, "Monthly Rent"],
        [0, "County"],
        [0, "State"]
    ],
    "column_types": [
        "number",
        "text",
        "number",
        "text",
        "text"
    ],
    "foreign_keys": [],
    "primary_keys": [0]
}

This schema reflects that:
- There's one table named "rentals"
- It has 5 columns with their respective data types
- Column1 appears to be an ID column and serves as the primary key
- There are no foreign keys since this is a single table
- The column types are determined based on the data content:
  * Column1: number (sequential ID)
  * Room Type: text
  * Monthly Rent: number
  * County: text
  * State: text
