I've copied and pasted an excerpt of a dataset at the end of this message.
Could you output a normalized database schema for the data in a JSON file called "table.json," with the following specification:
`tables.json` should contain the following information:
* `db_id`: database id
* `table_names`: cleaned and normalized table names for each table in the schema.
* `column_names`: original column names stored in the database. Each column looks like: `[0, "id"]`, where `0` is the index of a table name in `table_names`, and `"id"` is the column name.
* `column_types`: list containing data type of each column, in the order of the column names described above. Possible data types are "text", "number", and "time".
* `foreign_keys`: foreign keys in the database. `[3, 8]` means the third column in `column_name` is a foreign key reference to the eighth column.
* `primary_keys`: list of primary keys in the database. Each number is the index of `column_names`.

For this particular dataset, please omit four columns -- Score, Sample, Address2, and Address3 -- when generating the schema JSON.
