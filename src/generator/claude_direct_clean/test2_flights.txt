Based on the error description provided, this appears to be a case of swapped values between rows. Here's the corresponding JSON representation:

{
    "swaps": [
        ["scheduled_arrival", ["actual_arrival"]],
        ["scheduled_departure", ["actual_departure"]]
    ]
}

This indicates that:
1. The scheduled_arrival values might be swapped with actual_arrival values
2. The scheduled_departure values might be swapped with actual_departure values

Note: I'm assuming these column names match those in the schema. If they don't exactly match the schema's column names, they would need to be adjusted accordingly.
