I'll help you clean the dataset chunk by chunk. Let's start with the first 50 rows.

Looking at the first chunk, I notice several inconsistencies in arrival and departure times. I'll standardize them based on the most reliable sources and majority consensus. Here's how I'll clean the first 50 rows:

1. For AA-3859-IAH-ORD: Most sources agree on dep 7:16am, arr 9:22am
2. For AA-1733-ORD-PHX: Most sources show dep 7:58pm, arr 10:30pm
3. For AA-1640-MIA-MCO: Most sources show dep 6:47pm, arr 7:25pm
4. For AA-518-MIA-JFK: Most sources agree on dep 6:54am, arr 9:28am
5. For AA-3756-ORD-SLC: Most sources show dep 12:41pm, arr 2:50pm

Would you like me to proceed with the detailed corrections for the first 50 rows?
