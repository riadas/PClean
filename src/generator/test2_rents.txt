Based on the error description provided, I'll create a JSON with the relevant error types:

{
    "typos": ["County"],
    "unit_errors": [["Monthly Rent", 1000]]
}

Explanation:
- The description mentions typos in county names, so "County" is included in the `typos` array.
- The rent being sometimes reported in thousands of dollars instead of dollars is a unit error, where some values need to be multiplied by 1000 to be consistent.
- There's no mention of value swaps between rows, so the `swaps` field is omitted.
- While missing values are mentioned, they don't fit into any of the three error categories specified in the format, so they're not included in this error JSON.
- All column names used match exactly with those in the original schema JSON.
