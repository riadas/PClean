Based on the error description, I'll create a JSON file containing the error information. Since the description indicates there are typos in every column, and no other error types are mentioned, the JSON will only include the `typos` field with all column names from the schema:

{
    "typos": [
        "provider_number",
        "hospital_name",
        "address1",
        "city",
        "state",
        "zip_code",
        "county_name",
        "phone_number",
        "hospital_type",
        "hospital_owner",
        "emergency_service",
        "measure_code",
        "measure_name",
        "condition",
        "state_avg"
    ]
}

Note: I've included all unique column names from the schema (excluding duplicates from foreign key relationships), as the error description indicates that all columns contain typos.
