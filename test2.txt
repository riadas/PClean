Based on the error description provided, I'll create a JSON that captures the typos in county names and the unit inconsistency in rent values.

```json
{
  "typos": ["county"],
  "unit_errors": [["monthly_rent", 1000]]
}
```

This error description JSON captures:
1. Typos in the "county" column (e.g., we can see "Rockingham Counyt" in the data which should be "Rockingham County")
2. The monthly rent values sometimes being reported in thousands (need to multiply by 1000 to match the standard unit of dollars)

Note that while missing values were mentioned in the error description, they don't fit into any of the three error categories specified in the format (typos, unit_errors, or swaps), so they aren't included in the JSON output.

The column names used ("county" and "monthly_rent") exactly match those from the schema JSON we created earlier.
