Based on the dataset excerpt, I'll create a schema JSON file that excludes the Score, Sample, Address2, and Address3 columns. Here's the appropriate schema:

{
  "db_id": "hospital_data",
  "table_names": ["hospital_measures"],
  "column_names": [
    [0, "ProviderNumber"],
    [0, "HospitalName"],
    [0, "Address1"],
    [0, "City"],
    [0, "State"],
    [0, "ZipCode"],
    [0, "CountyName"],
    [0, "PhoneNumber"],
    [0, "HospitalType"],
    [0, "HospitalOwner"],
    [0, "EmergencyService"],
    [0, "Condition"],
    [0, "MeasureCode"],
    [0, "MeasureName"],
    [0, "Stateavg"]
  ],
  "column_types": [
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text"
  ],
  "foreign_keys": [],
  "primary_keys": [0]
}

Notes about this schema:
1. All columns are treated as "text" type since even numeric-looking fields (like ProviderNumber and ZipCode) contain non-numeric characters in some rows
2. ProviderNumber is set as the primary key (index 0)
3. There are no foreign keys in this single-table dataset
4. The excluded columns (Score, Sample, Address2, and Address3) are not included in the schema
5. All columns are part of a single table named "hospital_measures"
