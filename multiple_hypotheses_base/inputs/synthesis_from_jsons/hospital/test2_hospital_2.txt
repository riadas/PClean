Based on the error description stating that there are typos in every column, here's the appropriate error JSON:

{
  "typos": [
    "ProviderNumber",
    "HospitalName",
    "Address1",
    "City",
    "State",
    "ZipCode",
    "CountyName",
    "PhoneNumber",
    "HospitalType",
    "HospitalOwner",
    "EmergencyService",
    "Condition",
    "MeasureCode",
    "MeasureName",
    "Stateavg"
  ]
}

Note: Since the error description only mentions typos and doesn't mention any unit errors or swaps, I've omitted the `unit_errors` and `swaps` fields from the JSON. The `typos` array includes all column names from the schema JSON since the error description states that every column contains typos.
