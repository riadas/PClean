Based on the error description, I'll create a JSON with the relevant error types:

{
    "typos": ["county"],
    "unit_errors": [["monthly_rent", 1000]]
}

Explanation:
- The description mentions typos in county names, so "county" is included in the `typos` array.
- The rent being sometimes reported in thousands of dollars means there's a unit scale error where some values need to be multiplied by 1000 to be consistent, so this is included in `unit_errors`.
- There's no mention of value swaps between rows, so the `swaps` field is omitted entirely.
- The missing values mentioned in the description don't fit into any of the three error categories specified in the format, so they're not included in the JSON.
- The column names used match exactly with those in the schema JSON from earlier.
