Based on the dataset, I'll create a normalized database schema. Here's the JSON schema that follows the specified format:

{
  "db_id": "hospital_quality",
  "table_names": [
    "hospital",
    "measure"
  ],
  "column_names": [
    [0, "provider_number"],
    [0, "hospital_name"],
    [0, "address1"],
    [0, "phone_number"],
    [0, "hospital_type"],
    [0, "hospital_owner"],
    [0, "emergency_service"],
    [0, "city"],
    [0, "state"],
    [0, "zip_code"],
    [0, "county_name"],
    [1, "condition"],
    [1, "measure_code"],
    [1, "measure_name"],
    [1, "state_avg"],
  ],
  "column_types": [
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text",
    "text"
  ],
  "foreign_keys": [
  ],
  "primary_keys": [
    0,
    11,
  ]
}

Based on the dataset excerpt, I'll create a JSON schema that matches the specified format. Here's the "table.json" content:

{
    "db_id": "rental_properties",
    "table_names": ["location", "rental"],
    "column_names": [
        [0, "location_id"],
        [0, "county"],
        [0, "state"],
        [1, "column_id"],
        [1, "room_type"],
        [1, "monthly_rent"],
        [1, "location_id"],
    ],
    "column_types": [
        "number",
        "text",
        "text",
        "number",
        "text",
        "number",
        "number",
    ],
    "foreign_keys": [
        [6, 0],
    ],
    "primary_keys": [
        0,
        3
    ]
}

Based on the error description, I'll create a JSON with the relevant error types:

{
    "typos": ["county"],
    "unit_errors": [["monthly_rent", 1000]]
}

Explanation:
- The description mentions typos in county names, so "county" is included in the `typos` array.
- The rent being sometimes reported in thousands of dollars means there's a unit scale error where some values need to be multiplied by 1000 to be consistent, so this is included in `unit_errors`.
- There's no mention of value swaps between rows, so the `swaps` field is omitted entirely.
- The missing values mentioned in the description don't fit into any of the three error categories specified in the format, so they're not included in the JSON.
- The column names used match exactly with those in the schema JSON from earlier.

Based on the error description, I'll create a JSON with the relevant error types:

{
    "typos" : [
      "provider_number",
       "hospital_name",
       "address1",
       "city",
       "state",
       "zip_code",
       "county_name",
       "phone_number",
       "hospital_type",
       "hospital_owner",
       "emergency_service",
       "measure_code",
       "measure_name",
       "condition",
       "state_avg"
    ]
}
