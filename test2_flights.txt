Based on the error description provided, this appears to be a case of swapped values, where arrival and departure times might be incorrectly swapped between different sources for the same flight. Here's the appropriate error JSON:

{
  "swaps": [
    ["sched_dep_time", ["flight"]],
    ["act_dep_time", ["flight"]],
    ["sched_arr_time", ["flight"]],
    ["act_arr_time", ["flight"]]
  ]
}

This JSON indicates that:
- The time values (both scheduled and actual, for both arrival and departure) might be swapped between rows that share the same flight number
- I've used "flight" as the identifying column since it uniquely identifies a specific flight route
- I've omitted "typos" and "unit_errors" since the error description doesn't mention any issues related to those error types
