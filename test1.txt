Based on the dataset excerpt, I'll create a "table.json" file with the specified schema. The dataset appears to be about rental properties across different counties in the US.

```json
{
  "db_id": "rental_properties",
  "table_names": ["rentals"],
  "column_names": [
    [0, "id"],
    [0, "room_type"],
    [0, "monthly_rent"],
    [0, "county"],
    [0, "state"]
  ],
  "column_types": [
    "number",
    "text",
    "number",
    "text",
    "text"
  ],
  "foreign_keys": [],
  "primary_keys": [0]
}
```

This schema represents:
- A single table named "rentals"
- 5 columns:
  - id (from Column1): number type, primary key
  - room_type: text type
  - monthly_rent: number type
  - county: text type
  - state: text type
- No foreign keys since this is a single table
- The first column (id) is set as the primary key

The schema captures all the essential information from the dataset while following the specified format requirements.
