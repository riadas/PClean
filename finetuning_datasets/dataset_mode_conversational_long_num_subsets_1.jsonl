Sometimes the residents_resident_id value for a given residents_other_details value are different across different residents_date_moved_in values, when they should be the same. It should be inferred which of these is correct so all residents_date_moved_in values provide the same information.\n    \nGiven this dataset excerpt and error description, the goal is to write a PClean program that describes the schema of the dataset and the errors it contains. \n\nA good first step is to describe the schema of the dataset, since the structure of the PClean program closely follows the dataset schema.
